"""Narwal T10 error_code -> human-readable message.

Swept directly from the T10 app (com.narwal.robot_gloabl) by injecting each
code into the status stream and reading the dialog it displayed. The robot
reports error_code as a plain decimal in /pita/info/all; 0 means no error.
The T10 uses only 2001-2019 and 3001-3022 (a sibling model's community table
uses different numbers and does NOT apply here)."""
